A game engine and AI player for the board game Kingsburg.

**WIP**

Patterns it would be interesting to look at:

 * What is the "best" first resource?
 * Does it always follow a certain building progression? Is this affected by
   what other players do?

Here are some "intelligent" behaviors it would be interesting to see:

 * Dice blocking.
 * Intentionally not building to get the King's envoy.
 * Viewing the enemy and deciding to beat it.
 * Matching soliders with players who have viewed the enemy.
